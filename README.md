# Advertising-Analytics-Linear-Regression-Model
Introduction
In this notebook, we will explore the process of building a multi-linear regression model from scratch to predict sales based on advertising expenditure across various media channels. We will start by exploring and cleaning the data, followed by data visualization and preprocessing. We will then dive into the details of constructing the model, training it using gradient descent, and finally evaluating its performance. Additionally, we'll implement an interactive visualization for gradient descent to better understand the optimization process.
