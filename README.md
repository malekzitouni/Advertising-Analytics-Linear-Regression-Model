# Advertising-Analytics-Linear-Regression-Model
I've built a Linear Regression Model to predict sales based on advertising budgets across various media channels. By analyzing data from channels like TV, Radio, and Newspaper, I aimed to understand their impact on sales. The model achieved an accuracy of 91.2%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting consumer response to different ad spends.

Key Highlights:

Project Focus: Predicting sales using advertising budgets across media channels.
Model Used: Linear Regression
Accuracy: 91.2%

Introduction
In this notebook, we will explore the process of building a multi-linear regression model from scratch to predict sales based on advertising expenditure across various media channels. We will start by exploring and cleaning the data, followed by data visualization and preprocessing. We will then dive into the details of constructing the model, training it using gradient descent, and finally evaluating its performance. Additionally, we'll implement an interactive visualization for gradient descent to better understand the optimization process.
